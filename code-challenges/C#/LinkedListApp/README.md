# Singly Linked List
Implement a Singley-Linked List structure and test for accuracy.

## Challenge
* Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
* Within your LinkedList class, include a head property. Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.
* This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to head when the linked list is instantiated.
* Define a method called insert which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
* Define a method called includes which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Node’s value somewhere within the list.
* Define a method called print which takes in no arguments and returns a collection all of the current Node values in the Linked List.
## Approach & Efficiency

I have no idea what to put here...


## API

I don't know what goes here either... Is this a description of what methods in my challenge are declared publec?  Or is this "public" as in what can be used by other people?
